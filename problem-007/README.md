Problem 007
===========

Problem
-------
Imagine you are developing a GUI Editor which allows user to pick different shapes (that are supported such as Triangle, Rectangle, Circle, etc.), takes required inputs and draws the same.

Now you are required to model the solution for Holding information of Shapes and Drawing Shapes using different approaches such as:

* OOP approach
* Non-OOP approaches

At the end of it - highlight the difference, pros and cons of each of the approach you have used.

Also consider that once the shape is drawn, use may want to change the color, may want to fill with different color, change dimensions etc.

*Note*: You need to model the solution, need not create any executable
