Week 1
======

This is my solution to the week 1 problem in the Tally Programming Club (problem shown below).

In order to check the solution, I have created another version (p1-withdisplay.c) which will show a neat display.

Coin Changing Problem
---------------------
Calculate the following sequence of fractions:
How many ways are there to make change for Rs. 100, if you have notes for Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 20, Rs. 50 and Rs. 100.

Some hints and comments.
* One Rs. 100/- note is also considered to be change.
* 100 Rs 1 notes is one example of change. So are 5 Rs. 20 notes. List a few before thinking about the problem.
* The number of ways of making change for Rs. 50 is 451. Use this to check whether your approach works or not.
* It is usually helpful to gain intuition about how to solve the problem by doing simpler cases. For example, how many ways are there to make change for Rs. N, where N is 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
* In your solution, you should consider how you can solve related problems. For example, if you have to find change for Rs. 100, but the notes available are just for Rs. 1, 2, and 5. How would you modify your solution to do this problem? What are the answers you get?
